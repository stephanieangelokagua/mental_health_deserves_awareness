## User Stories

Here is where we write a few user stories. Example:

- The user wants to be able to connect with the business.
- The user would like to see other people's reviews on our sevices...

## Design

### Colour palette

The color scheme of the webpage is inspired from an image. I used Coolors to extract the colors from my chosen image and then played around with its automatic pallete generator to get the remaining colors needed. I made sure to use a color pallete that was ideal for the nature of the topic

### Typography 

For this project, I used Foto sans for header text and Roboto for body text. Due to the nature of the project it was important to use a font that was calm and easy to read to encourage users to progress through the webpage's content. I used google fonts and set the filter to calm and then based on preference selected by desired font for my header text and a suitable supporting body font.

### Imagery

Images are an important component of this website because different users have different needs. For instance, some users learn best using images whilst others learn through text. I  integrated both of this into the webpage and used Pexels and Open AI to generate the images. I used images from Pexels for my Carouesel images and Open AI images generated using DALL-E for my other sections.

## Deployment

- Discuss how you used Git to track your building progress

During this project, Git was an essential tracking tool used to monitor the progress of the website towards final deployments. Git commits were used to allow version tracking and restoring previous states if needed amongst Git push, Git pull, Git add. These commits were stored and Github was used to store the project and deploy the site.

GitHub was used to deploy the website. These were the steps taken to acheive this:  

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Navigate to the project repository, mental_health_deserves_awareness
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu, find and click on the Pages button
5. In the Source section, choose 'main' from the drop-down, select branch menu
6. Select 'root' from the drop-down folder menu
7. Click 'Save' and after a few moments the project will have been made live and a link is visible at the top of the page
