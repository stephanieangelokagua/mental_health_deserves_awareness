## User Stories

Here is where we write a few user stories. Example:

- The user wants to be able to connect with the business.
- The user would like to see other people's reviews on our sevices...

## Design

Here we discuss the design in terms of:

- colour palette (use Coolors image or link)

The color scheme of the webpage is inspired from an image. I used Coolors to extract the colors from my chosen image and then played around with its automatic pallete generator to get the remaining colors needed. I made sure to use a color pallete that was ideal for the nature of the topic
- typography (show what typeface and why you choose it)

For this project, I used Foto sans for header text and Roboto for body text. Due to the nature of the project it was important to use a font that was calm and easy to read to encourage users to progress through the webpage's content. I used google fonts and set the filter to calm and then based on preferenc selected by desired font for my header text. 
- Imagery

Images are an important component of this website because different users have different needs. For instance, some users learn best using images whilst others learn through text. I  integrated both of this into the webpage and used Pexels and Open AI to generate the images. 

- Features (general site features, like sections and pages that fulfil teh user stories/requirements)
