## Design

### Colour palette

The color scheme of the webpage is inspired from an image on the subject of mental health. I used Coolors to extract the colors from my chosen image and then played around with its automatic pallete generator to get the remaining colors needed. I made sure to use a color pallete that was ideal for the nature of the topic

### Typography 

For this project, I used Foto sans for header text and Roboto for body text. Due to the nature of the project it was important to use a font that was calm and easy to read to encourage users to progress through the webpage's content. I used google fonts and set the filter to calm and then based on preference selected by desired font for my header text and a suitable supporting body font.

### Imagery

Images are an important component of this website because different users have different needs. For instance, some users learn best using images whilst others learn through text. I  integrated both of this into the webpage and used Pexels and Open AI to generate the images. I used images from Pexels for my Carouesel images and Open AI images generated using DALL-E for my other sections. 

- Features (general site features, like sections and pages that fulfil teh user stories/requirements)

### Features

#### Navigation bar

To achieve the user story on easy to use navigation, I developed a navigation bar that includes a hamburger icon on mobile and tablet screens and the page links alone on laptop screens

#### Call to action button: Subscribe to newsletter

To achieve the user story on allowing users to subscribe and stay updated, the call to action button was linked to two modals. The first modal allows the user to enter their name and email and click a sign up button which takes them to the second modal showing the success of their request

#### Positive affirmations 

To achieve the user story on providing positive affirmations to users, a carousel of encouraging images on the topic was designed into the project and consequently served as the hero image for the project

## Deployment

- Discuss how you used Git to track your building progress

During this project, Git was an essential tracking tool used to monitor the progress of the website towards final deployments. Git commits were used to allow version tracking and restoring previous states if needed amongst Git push, Git pull, Git add. These commits were stored and Github was used to store the project and deploy the site.

GitHub was used to deploy the website. These were the steps taken to acheive this:  

1. Login to GitHub account
2. Navigate to the project repository, mental_health_deserves_awareness
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu, find and click on the Pages button
5. In the Source section, choose 'main' from the drop-down, select branch menu
6. Select 'root' from the drop-down folder menu
7. Click 'Save' and after a few moments the project will have been made live and a link is visible at the top of the page
