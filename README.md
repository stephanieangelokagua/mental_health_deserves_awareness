## Design

### Colour palette

The color scheme of the webpage is inspired from an image. I used Coolors to extract the colors from my chosen image and then played around with its automatic pallete generator to get the remaining colors needed. I made sure to use a color pallete that was ideal for the nature of the topic

### Typography 

For this project, I used Foto sans for header text and Roboto for body text. Due to the nature of the project it was important to use a font that was calm and easy to read to encourage users to progress through the webpage's content. I used google fonts and set the filter to calm and then based on preference selected by desired font for my header text and a suitable supporting body font.

### Imagery

Images are an important component of this website because different users have different needs. For instance, some users learn best using images whilst others learn through text. I  integrated both of this into the webpage and used Pexels and Open AI to generate the images. I used images from Pexels for my Carouesel images and Open AI images generated using DALL-E for my other sections.
