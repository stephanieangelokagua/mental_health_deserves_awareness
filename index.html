                        social and emotional wellbeing of people and
                        communities.
                        The concept relates to the enjoyment of life, ability
                        to cope with stress and sadness, the fulfilment of
                        goals and potential, and a sense of connection to
                        others. Mental health is about wellness rather than
                        illness and is not merely the absence of a mental
                        health condition. </p>

                <p>We all know that to keep a car going, we have to fill it with petrol, check the oil and water
                    regularly and give the tires some air. To see a bank balance grow, we need to make steady deposits.
                    But how often do we take the time to reflect on whether we are giving ourselves what we need to
                    flourish and live well?
                    It can be so easy for us to take our mental health for granted; to prioritise other things; to put
                    it off until next week. It can also seem too big and too hard. But it’s not. There are some things
                    everyone can do. The following are some tips to get you started</p>

                                Finding ways to manage stress is essential for a peaceful mind and body. Practice
                                relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga, or meditation. Journaling can help
                                process emotions and release tension in a healthy way. Explore activities that make you
                                feel calm, from art to nature walks. Make time for hobbies that allow you to unwind and
                                recharge. Taking control of stress can lead to a more fulfilling life.</p>

                                friends, family, or loved ones, sharing moments and creating memories. Show
                                appreciation, listen actively, and be there for each other. Building positive
                                relationships can improve resilience and bring joy. Remember, we are stronger together.

                                Sleep plays a crucial role in both our physical and mental well-being. Yet, it’s often
                                the first thing we sacrifice when life gets hectic. A full night’s rest helps our body
                                repair, supports immune function, and stabilizes mood. Prioritizing sleep can improve
                                focus, energy, and resilience to stress. Create a calming bedtime routine and avoid
                                screens before sleeping. Remember, quality rest is a key foundation for a balanced,
                                healthy life.</p>

                                Our physical health is deeply connected to how we feel emotionally. Engaging in regular
                                exercise can lift our spirits and reduce stress. A balanced diet fuels our body and
                                mind, enhancing concentration and mood stability. Aim for a mix of fruits, vegetables,
                                and whole grains in your meals. Set aside time each day for physical activities, even if
                                it’s just a brisk walk. Small steps toward wellness can make such big difference in your

                                assistance. Don’t hesitate to reach out when you need it most.</p>
